# Gridsome

## Notes

Create a new site with

```bash
gridsome create <project>
```

Start development server in the project root \(ie `cd <project>` after `create`\)

```bash
gridsome develop
```

For production

```bash
gridsome build
```

This will copy anything from `./static` into `./dist` as well as populate `./dist` with the generated pages to host.
